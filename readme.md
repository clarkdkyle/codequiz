I have had a lot of trouble trying to get this homework.
While learing Dom I had trouble learning which functions to use in the code. I tried implementing Jquery instead which I enjoyed learning but implementing it in place of javascript has caused me some confusion when it comes to which functions to use in their place.

I was greatful for the extension in time of the homework unfortunately my work and personal life has left me with not enough time to create the proper code to make my page work properly
